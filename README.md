## Fund Me

Frontend for my Fund Me Solidity contract that is deployed on the Sepolia testnet. This project was simply made for fun, as I wanted to try out using the Wagmi web3 library as opposed to what I usually use, Ethers.

### Technology Used

- NextJS + TypeScript as the framework
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Wagmi for the web3 frontend library
- Alchemy for the RPC endpoint
- Vercel for deployment
